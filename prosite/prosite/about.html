<h1>Our origin story</h1>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tourists loved our coffee in Greeley but forgot us after the trip. Local flavor wasn’t making it back home.</p>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> We roast weekly and ship nationwide so the cup you loved on vacation follows you home—fresh, fast, and sustainable.</p>
